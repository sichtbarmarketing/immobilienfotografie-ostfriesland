To properly implement these images, you'll need to:

1. Create a `/public/images/` directory in your project
2. Add high-quality real estate photography images with the filenames specified above
3. Make sure the images are properly sized and optimized for web use (consider using WebP format for better performance)
4. Ensure you have the rights to use any images you add to your website

For the best results:
- Use professional real estate photography with good lighting
- Choose images that showcase different types of properties
- Include a mix of interior, exterior, and aerial shots
- For virtual homestaging, include clear before/after comparisons
- Make sure all images are high resolution but optimized for web (typically 1200-2000px wide)
